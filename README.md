# Cyber Aurora 

-A flower that grows in the cold cyber world. It signifies a new hope and beginning, being calm and responsible despite being alone in the dark.

This mandala art shapes are made by manipulating circles and octagons using loops.<br/>
Its colors are inspired by 'Aurora borealis', the lights of the northern hemisphere, implemented using conditionals and arrays.<br/> 
I made this design because I like the idea of using this existing magical and mysterious nature colors to create a futuristic look.<br />
