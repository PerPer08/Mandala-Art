# Cyber Aurora 

A flower that grows in the cold cyber world.

This Mandala Art of mine is formed by octagons that rotates like a spirograph in a loop to create more shapes like diamond,square etc. .
I chose octagon as a base shape because of its circle like shape thus it can create hypotrochoids.
I chose the shades of my favorite color which is blue.
